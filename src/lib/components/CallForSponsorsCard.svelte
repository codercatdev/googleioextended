		Google Developer Groups (GDGs) are for developers who are interested in Google's development
		technology; everything from Android, App Engine, and Google Chrome platforms, to product APIs
		like the Maps API, YouTube API and Google Calendar API. A GDG can take many forms -- from just a
		few people getting together to watch the latest video, to large gatherings with demos and tech
		talks, to events like code sprints and hackathons. However, at the core, GDGs are focused on
		developers and technical content, with a target audience of developers. This group is the Grand
		Rapids, MI chapter!
