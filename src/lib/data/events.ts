Recently, I have been challenged to question the assumptions and confidence that I have in Scrum and I was very surprised at what I discovered.

		I now feel obligated to share what lessons I have learned through challenging these assumptions and how we can embrace the Agile Principal of Continuous Improvement in order to lead us and our organizations into the next phase of Software Development Methodology => Continuous Delivery

In many of the videos on my TheFlutterWay YouTube channel, I have experienced how people can create perfect UIs just like their designers have wanted. By bringing this experience, in this talk I will explain how experts apply simple, straightforward, incremental techniques to build pixel-perfect UI on flutter and turn it into something memorable.`,

		summary: 'In this talk, we will explore how to implement a monorepo workflow for your design system using PNPM workspaces, NX, and SvelteKit.',
		body: `In this talk, we will explore how to implement a monorepo workflow for your design system using PNPM workspaces, NX, and SvelteKit. By consolidating all your packages and sites into a single codebase, you can streamline your development, packaging, and publishing process.

		We will start by introducing the concept of monorepos and their benefits, before diving into the specific tools and frameworks that make it possible. We will explore PNPM workspaces, a lightweight package manager that allows you to manage all your dependencies within a single repository.
		
		Next, we will discuss NX, a powerful tool for building monorepo-based projects. NX provides a suite of tools for managing your monorepo, including code generators, testing tools, and much more. We will explore how to use NX to set up your monorepo and manage your design system components.
		
		Finally, we will discuss SvelteKit, a framework for building web applications that is optimized for monorepo workflows. We will explore how to use SvelteKit to build out your design system components and how it can easily package up your components for publishing to NPM.
		
		By the end of this talk, you will have a clear understanding of how to implement a monorepo workflow for your design system using PNPM workspaces, NX, and SvelteKit. You will be able to streamline your development process, improve code consistency, and make it easier to manage your design system components.

		summary:
			'In this workshop, we will show how to use Svelte Kit and Firebase to build CodingCat.dev using BlackCatUI.',
		body: `Svelte Kit and Firebase are two of the most popular tools for building modern web applications. Svelte Kit is a framework that makes it easy to build web applications with Svelte, while Firebase is a cloud-based backend as a service that provides a number of features, including authentication, storage, and databases.

        In this workshop, we will show how to use Svelte Kit and Firebase to build CodingCat.dev using BlackCatUI. We will cover the following topics:
        
        Setting up Svelte Kit and Firebase
        Authenticating users with Svelte Kit
        Storing user data in Firestore
        
        By the end of this workshop, you will be able to build a simple web application with authentication using Svelte Kit and Firebase. `,

		body: `Companies all over the world have fallen into the Velocity Trap. This is when companies only measure how fast teams are completing tasks. They forget that those tasks need to be of value to their users, customers, and their business. In fact, research has shown that 80% of software products are rarely or never used. This talk looks at what makes organizations profitable. It uses concepts from Product Thinking and User Experience to explain how you can identify what efforts are worth investing in. It also shares which productivity metrics (also known as outputs) are proven through research to promote high performance and a few common metrics that have no such correlation. Join this talk to learn how to escape the Velocity Trap!`,
